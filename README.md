# Coroutines

### What are coroutines? 
A coroutine is a function that can suspend its execution until the given YieldInstruction has finished. Thus, coroutines can execute code over a certain number of frames.
Coroutines stop after the GameObject from which it has been called is deactivated or destroyed.

Yield indicates that the method is an iterator and that itâ€™s going to execute over more than one frame, while return, like in a regular function, terminates execution at that point and passes control back to the calling method.

There are different types of yield instructions:
- yield return null: Waits until the next frame before continuing the coroutine
- yield return WaitForSeconds(float seconds): specifies an exact amount of time to wait
- yield return WaitUntil(bool predicate): stops the execution until a delegate evaluates to true
- yield return WaitWhile(bool predicate): waits for a delegate to be false before proceeding
- yield return WaitForEndOfFrame(): Waits until Unity has rendered every Camera and UI element, just before actually displaying the frame

### Advantages of coroutines:
Executing code consecutively using Coroutines is simple and intuitive. Using the yield keyword, Coroutines can be organized as "To-Do Lists" without having to implement countless if-statements. Respectively, implementing design patterns like State Machines only become practical by using coroutines.

### Usecases of coroutines: 
Whenever an action needs to pause, perform a series of consecutive steps or generally takes longer than a single frame, a Coroutine is useful. As stated above, desing patterns like State Machines rely heavily on Coroutines. Also, performance-heavy tasks (not necessarily having to run over multiple frame) like loading a scene can be executed in coroutines, for then they can run in the background using AsyncOperation.

### When not to use coroutines:
Coroutines shouldn't be used for foreground tasks, operations executed in a single frame (if they're not too performance-heavy), or initialization.
